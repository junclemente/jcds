**jcds** is a modular Python library (hosted in the [jcds-lib](https://github.com/junclemente/jcds) repository) designed to support reproducible workflows in data science and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
It provides a curated collection of functions for inspecting, transforming, and accessing tabular data from local and cloud sources, with particular emphasis on usability within Jupyter notebooks.

📚 This project originated during my time as a graduate student in the **MSADS (Master of Science in Applied Data Science)** program at the [University of San Diego](https://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/graduate/ms-applied-data-science.php).  
I often ran into repetitive tasks — inspecting nulls, handling encodings, wrangling column names, or working with messy CSVs and S3-hosted files — across multiple class and capstone projects.  
To address these real-world pain points, I began building **jcds** as a personal toolkit grounded in **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles — and have been pair programming alongside **Generative AI 🤖** to refine and expand it throughout my learning journey.

> ✅ **Compatible with Python 3.7 and above. Developed and tested on Python 3.10.**

### 🌐 Import with `httpimport`

Use [`httpimport`](https://pypi.org/project/httpimport/) directly in Jupyter:

```python
import httpimport

with httpimport.github_repo('junclemente', 'jcds', ref='<branch>'):
    import jcds as jcds
```

You can also import specific submodules:

```python
import jcds.eda as eda
```

---

### 🧪 Minimal Usage Example

```python
import pandas as pd
import jcds.eda as jeda

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

---

### 📓 More Examples

See the EDA workflow notebook:

- [examples/eda_workflow.ipynb](./examples/eda_workflow.ipynb)

---

## 🌿 Branching Info

When specifying the `ref` in `httpimport.github_repo()`:

- `develop` – Actively evolving 🚧
- `0.x.x` – Stable and reproducible ✅

> 🔒 Recommended: Use a versioned tag for reproducibility.

---

## 🆘 Help System

Each subpackage has a built-in `help()` function.

### 🌍 Global help

```python
import jcds
jcds.help()
```

### 📁 Subpackage-specific help

```python
import jcds.eda
jcds.eda.help()

import jcds.aws as jaws
jaws.help()
```

### 🔎 Function-level help

```python
jcds.eda.help('dqr_cat')
```

## 📚 Documentation

📄 [jcds documentation](https://junclemente.github.io/jcds)

Built with:

- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/)

### 🔁 Updating the Docs

1. **Update or Add Docstrings**
   - Use [NumPy](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) or Google-style docstrings in your `.py` files.
   - These serve as the foundation for manual documentation or future automated doc generation.

2. **Edit Markdown Files**
   - Update existing `.md` files or create new ones in the `docs/` folder.
   - Update `mkdocs.yml` to reflect new pages or sections in the sidebar.

3. **Preview Locally**
   Run the following command to launch a local web server:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Then open the URL:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

4. Deploy to GitHub Pages:

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
This will:

Build the site

Push it to the gh-pages branch

Automatically publish at:
